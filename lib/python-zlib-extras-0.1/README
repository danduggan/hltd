About python-zlib-extras
--------------------

This is python-zlib-extras, a Python interface to checksum combination zlib library functions

This package is *not* "official" python zlib bindings

-------------------------------

The official bindings does not contain interface to adler32_combine and crc32_combine,
therefore this library includes them and some additional functions

Building and using
-------------------------------
Run:
rm -rf build;
python setup.py build

It will create a library file which needs to be copied to site-packages directory:
sudo cp build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/zlibextras.so /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/zlibextras.so
(notice: in this version _zlibextras.so is created, this is just a special version to avoid library name clash)

Now the library can be used in python, for example:
>import zlibextras
>print zlibextras.adler32_combine(1,2,3)
